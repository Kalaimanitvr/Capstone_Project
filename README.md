## 🏆 Project Summary
This project leverages data analytics to explore, analyze, and extract actionable insights from football data. It combines descriptive, predictive, and exploratory techniques to answer business-critical questions in the football domain, such as:
- How do player attributes influence performance and market value?
- What factors drive stadium attendance trends?
- How can machine learning models predict outcomes like yellow cards or starting lineups?

As a **data analyst**, I focused on transforming raw data into meaningful insights using advanced analysis and visualization techniques.
